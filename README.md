# SecurIOT
Security test bed for IOT device information leak and vulnerability scanning

Idea is to enable script kiddies to describe and test IOT devices for vulnerabilities and 
to figure out what data they are leaking if any.

pcap contains code to parse a pcap file and make wordclouds of destinations for each source IP
together with host:port specific destination port wordclouds.

Because we can.
